Computational Intelligence Project: Neural Net
=============================================

Description
-----------
Project developed during Computational Intelligence Course. Project aims for creating a classifier, which in turn will be used as a part of AGE framework ([project page](http://age.iisg.agh.edu.pl)) and evaluated on a selected data set. 

[Initial presentation](AUTOMATED%20CLASSIFICATION%20OF%20LIGHT%20CURVES%20OF%20ECLIPSING%20BINARIES.pptx)

1. Implementation of Neural Network ([info](neural_network.md))
2. Evaluation on dataset common to all groups: Human Activity Recognition ([data source with description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones))
3. Evaluation on group-specific dataset: Eclipsing Binaries Light Curves ([info](dataset.md), [data source](http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/?page=acvs))
