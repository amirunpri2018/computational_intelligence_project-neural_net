Computational Intelligence Project: Neural Net
=============================================

Description
-----------
Project developed during Computational Intelligence Project Course. Project aims for creating a classifier, which in turn will be used as a part of AGE framework (http://age.iisg.agh.edu.pl) and evaluated on a selected data set. 

1. Implementation of Neural Network ([link](neural_network.md))
2. Evaluation on dataset common to all groups: Human Activity Recognition ([data source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones))
3. Evaluation on group-specific dataset: Eclisping Binaries Light Curves ([info](dataset.md), [data source](http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/?page=acvs))
