Dataset

Description
-----------

Group-specific dataset consists of light curves of three different types of eclipsing binaries. 
Light curve is a curve representing brightness of star or star system plotted against time.

Characteristic curve shapes correspond to different types of objects. 
Eclipsing binary stars are star systems where each star periodically eclipse the other. 
Depending on the distance between the stars the system can fall into one of three categories:

- detached
- semi-detached
- contact

Data acquisition
----------------

Data is acquired from ASAS catalogue of variable stars ([link](http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/?page=main)). Light curves are downloaded in bulk from [download site](http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/?page=download). Light curve description (with categories) are obtained by scraping from search site displaying [all results](http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/?page=show&qty=all).
